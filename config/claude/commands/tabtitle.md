description: Refresh tab title
---

Use the command `wezterm cli set-tab-title "Title"` to rename current WezTerm tab you're running in, so it reflect the subject of the current session. Keep the tab title compact. In case the session is related to a specific Jira issue or a PR (e.g. code review) add the ID of that entity to the tab title.
