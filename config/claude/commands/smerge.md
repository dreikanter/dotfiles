Open Sublime Merge for the current working directory by running `smerge .`

**IMPORTANT**: Run this command exactly once. Do NOT retry or run additional commands if you see shell hook errors (like "parse error near '()'"). These errors are from unrelated shell scripts and do not indicate the smerge command failed.
